# SQL Mini Project: Analyzing Unicorn Companies
## 1. Project Overview:
 This project involves analyzing a dataset of unicorn companies, which are privately held
 companies valued at over $1 billion as of November 2021. The project will include data creation,
 analysis using SQL, and answering specific questions about the dataset.

 ## 2. CSV Data Structure:
 You can use the following CSV structure to represent the dataset:
 
 Company,Country,Sector,Valuation (Billion USD),Founded Year,Select Investors
 
 SpaceX,United States,Aerospace,100.3,2002,Fidelity, Founders Fund, Baillie Gifford

 ## Conclusion
 In this SQL mini project, I created a database of unicorn companies, inserted  relevant data, and conducted analyses to uncover trends related to sectors, 
countries, and investors. Key findings include: 

  The United States leads in unicorn creation, while FinTech is the most 
valuable sectors.

  Fidelity; Founders Fund is the most common investor, reflecting its strong 
presence in the startup ecosystem.

  Companies founded in the 2010s have higher average valuations compared to 
earlier decades, highlighting recent growth in the startup landscape.

 This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to effectively analyze and 
interpret data from a variety of perspectives, providing valuable insights into the 
unicorn startup ecosystem
